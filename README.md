# FreeGeek Chicago Install Script

This repository provides the files FreeGeek Chicago uses to make changes to the base installation of our Xubuntu or Ubuntu installations. The two files available in this repository do the following:
- **install.txt** is a short script that pulls down the current install.sh from github. It resides on FreeGeek Chicago's webserver at http://freegeekchicago.org/files/install.txt
- **install.sh** is the script that does the heavy lifting. install.txt places install.sh in the /usr/local/bin folder.
